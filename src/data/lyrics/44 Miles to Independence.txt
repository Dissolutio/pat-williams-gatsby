Title: 44 Miles to Independence

--------------------------

Verse 1:

I'm burned out again

I won't do that on the road

Wild flowers don't deserve it

And two wheels got me feelin' gold


Can I just keep riding

To catch a plane across the pond?

To rack up some demerits

Or make a living playing ball


	
Chorus:

And it's 44 miles to independence

Is this sign trying to say

Something John Wayne would
				
That courage is being scared to death and saddling up on anyway


Verse 2:

I'm no soldier now

I guess I never really was

But soon to be a father

And find out the true meaning of love


But still I'm out here hiding

On the other side of town

Highway 6 is far behind me

I keep 4 wheels spinnin' on the ground


Chorus: 

And it's 44 miles to independence

Is this sign trying to say

Something John Wayne would
				
That courage is being scared to death and saddling up on anyway


Bridge:


I guess it's time to face my fears

But I don't know what I should do

And working hard is all i've ever known

And things turn out as they should

Yeah things turn out as they should


Chorus (modified):

And it's 44 miles to independence

I've been down this road before

But unlike the last time, I turn around and charge right back to your door
