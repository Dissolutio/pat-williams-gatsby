Title: Wrong Side (Bygones)

--------------------------

Verse 1: 

Woke up this morning

Got out of bed

Poured a cup of coffee

Into my head

Looked out the window

At my flower bed

Goddamn if the flowers

weren't all dead


So I woke up my woman

Said what's this about

How you gonna treat me this way

When I'm out and about

I bring home the bacon

Yeah a couple of beers

And all I get when I get home

Is your ramblin' tears



Chorus:

And I woke on the wrong side of the bed

And you woke up on the wrong side of me

And you don't even care how I feel anyway 

But we'll just let the bygones be

Yeah we'll let the bygones be



Verse 2:


A couple weeks later

I get home from work

No dinner on the table

Things are looking worse

So I called out your name

Told you to come here

Said I got something for ya

But you beat me there



I didn't see it coming

when I walked in the door

You hit me with my little league bat

and I fell to the floor

I'll never forget

That sound it made

Sounded like a coconut shell

Getting just what it gave


Chorus:

And I walked in the wrong side of the door

And you walked in on the wrong side of me

And you don't even care how I feel anyway

But baby let the bygones be

Please baby let the bygones be


Chorus:

You were fed up with the wrong side of me

I was begging with the light side in you                                  

But you don't even care how I feel anyway

And you can't let the bygones be

No you can't let the bygones be
