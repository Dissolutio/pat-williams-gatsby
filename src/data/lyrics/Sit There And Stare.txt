Title: Sit There and Stare

------------------------------------------


Verse 1:

You've got super speed, the power to fly,

x-ray vision and still you just sigh.

The whole world needs you but we had you first

and now you're not here when we need you the most.


All of the people are praying to you

but it don't mean much if it don't get through

Your head's always down and you don't say a word

As the people who love you are starting to die


Chorus:

You're a super hero but still not a man

You gave up the gig and now we're both here alone

I don't want no so-called hero

To sit on his ass and watch us cry

And we scream and we scream and we scream and scream

That life's just not fair, and you just sit there...

You just sit there and stare.


Verse 2:

The name of the game was doing good

But that was the past and this is the now

You gave up on us so we'll give up on you

And don't come crawlin back when you need us too

The hope that you had is long gone now

And not just for you, it's gone for us too

We muscled on, so what's your excuse?

Having trouble now without your full troupe?


Bridge:

You're a super hero!  

You're a so-called hero who doesn't do much

when people call to you. Doesn't do much

when people beg for you. Doesn't do much

when people pray to you.


Verse 3:

The months pass by and still not a word

You packed up shop and didn't leave a note

You left your friends out in the street

On the day that you admitted defeat


You missed the attention and came back to beg

To win back our hearts and forget the dead

But we don't need you, yeah we did just fine.

So get the hell out we disrespectfully decline.
