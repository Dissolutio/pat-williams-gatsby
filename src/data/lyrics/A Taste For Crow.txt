Title: A Taste For Crow

------------------------------------------

Verse 1:

I'm so lucky, that she's my lady
She always lets me go out with the boys
We go a hootin and hollerin round
Never do too much harm in this town

We go to the same place every time
The beer is cold and the women are fine
I may give em' a wink but I shoot 'em down
But when I get home, she's wearin a frown

Chorus:

I'm gettin' a taste for that old crow, baby.
I'm always wrong, and you're always right.
That egg on my face, still runnin down.
It's all sunny side up from here on out.

Verse 2:

I wish that she was still my lady
Home from work and it's not home
The silence broken by the twist of a cap
Pour my sorrow to the rim of the glass

And then I work up the courage to go
To that old place and the people I know
They tell me something that sounds like a crime
You're dancing with him for the 1000th time

Bridge:

And I'm sittin here thinkin about what you said
Of all the times I showed up late to bed
And I can't help but wonder why
Cause loving you was a constant all the time

Chorus (modified):

I hope you'll taste some of that old crow, baby.
I think you'll like it as much I do
That egg on my face, still runnin down.
It's all sunny side up from here on out.
